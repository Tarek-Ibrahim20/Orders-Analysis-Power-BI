# Project Overview
## Order Dashboard by using Power BI 
Leveraging a comprehensive sales dataset, we meticulously cleaned and transformed the data using Power Query. By establishing a robust data model in Power BI, we seamlessly linked tables and formulated essential DAX measures.


Our focus culminated in crafting a dynamic dashboard that delves into crucial insights such as order volumes, sales figures, quantities, orders per territory, monthly and yearly order trends, and order statuses.
